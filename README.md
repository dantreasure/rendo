# Rendo

This is a gem to help support teaching regular expressions. The idea is to play
a game of Zendo to figure out the meaning of various regular expression
syntaxes. You set a list of regular expressions to try, and then call
`Rendo.run`, which will start an interactive interpreter. In the interpreter,
you (if doing a presentation) or the student can type in strings to test and
the interpreter will show you which part of the string matches.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rendo'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rendo
