# Rendo

This is a gem to help teach regular expressions by playing a game similar to
Zendo. The idea is to let the learners test strings to figure out the meaning
of various regular expression syntaxes.

You can set a list of regular expressions to try and then start the interactive
interpreter. In the interpreter, you can type in strings to test and the
interpreter will show you which part of the string matches. Special commands are
indicated by prefixing the "!" character to the command. For example:

```
!help
```

## Installation
